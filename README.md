# Pemukin_Catania
This is an university project.   
The purpose is to model the game "The columns of Catan" (in a simplified way) in Java.  
We were looking for an original name related to Java and this game.  
So we decided to transcribe its name in Javanese, a language spoken on the island of Java in Indonesia.  
That leads us to the name : **Pemukin Catania.**
